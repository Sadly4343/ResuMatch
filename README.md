This project works to address recent graduates and developing a space for them to store all of the job applications in a singular website that will allow them to track and implement AI into developing and improving the overall design of the resume they are applying for that specific job application and keep track of the current status of the application as well.

“Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.”

― Steve Jobs
