Instructions on how to use this web app

User will register on the site in order to create a user Id and that will allow you to be sent to the login page where you can now login to the project.

You will be redirected to the Dashboard that shows applications and calendar view of those applications where you can store and record dates for steps in the interview process for job applications.

The next page will be the resume page where your files will be saved in an S3 bucket to each specific user and allow you to pull or delete those resumes on your own saved page.

The Tools page allows you to input your entire resume through copy and paste and also copy and paste your existing job application description from any site to Compare using OPEN AI integration the exact connection in percentage of how well your resume works to meet the goals of that job. The page also includes an easy to use and efficient cover letter generator that uses the same OPEN AI to implement and improve the simplicity of creating a cover letter that is clean and organized based on your inputs.

Finally you are given a calendar page to view your upcoming applications and the deadlines for your applications for those specific jobs.


This project works to address recent graduates and developing a space for them to store all of the job applications in a singular website that will allow them to track and implement AI into developing and improving the overall design of the resume they are applying for that specific job application and keep track of the current status of the application as well.

“Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.”

― Steve Jobs
